and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `FirewallPolicy` now exposes domain and application matching criteria, so a rule narrowed to specific destinations is no longer indistinguishable from a wide-open one (closes #68). New fields: `destination_web_domains`, `destination_web_matching_type`, `destination_app_ids`, plus `source_matching_target` and `destination_matching_target`. The matching-target pair is the general signal — a value other than `"ANY"` means the rule is narrowed even when the criteria are not parsed into a list, so criteria this model does not yet decode (regions, app categories) still cannot read as unrestricted. All fields default to empty, so existing consumers are unaffected. Verified against a live 156-policy ruleset: the three domain- and application-restricted rules previously appeared to allow all protocols and ports
- New `unifi` icon set (`SvgTheme(icon_set="unifi")`), bundled under `assets/icons/icons-unifi/`. Original MIT-licensed artwork covering all 14 node types with no fallbacks, replacing several semantically wrong isopacks mappings: access points are ceiling discs rather than radio towers, NAS is a drive enclosure rather than a database cylinder, and `client_cluster` is a group of devices rather than a person. The existing `isometric` (isopacks) and `modern` sets are unchanged and remain the default
- `SvgOptions.iso_compact_layout` (default `False`): packs isometric nodes into per-hub districts instead of laying every sibling along one diagonal. The previous layout mapped sibling order to one grid axis and tree depth to the other, so a shallow, wide network became a thin diagonal strip — 89 nodes produced a 166x4 grid on a 21504x12296 canvas. Compact packing brings that to 5904x4675, raises node density from 0.4 to 5.1 nodes per megapixel, and cuts mean edge length by roughly half
- `scripts/normalize_icon_viewbox.py`: retargets an icon set's root `viewBox` so every icon fills the same fraction of its square frame. Icons are drawn into a fixed square with `xMidYMid meet`, so uneven internal margins made some devices render as specks

### Fixed
- `FirewallPolicy.source_mac_addresses` was always empty against zone-based controllers. The nested parser read `mac_addresses`, but the controller sends `client_macs`; both keys are now accepted. On a live ruleset this left 8 MAC-restricted policies looking unrestricted
- Isometric layout could place two nodes on the same grid cell, silently stacking them. A parent's position was the mean of its children's indices, so two switches feeding one client resolved to the same tile (three nodes shared a tile in a 30-node topology). Only affects the new compact layout path; the default tree layout is unchanged pending a wider fix

## [3.0.2] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- `lookup_model_name` (and the `_stats` model-name fallback) again resolve model strings that only survive as an entry's `name` after the store-to-firmware-code re-keying of the bundled model database (e.g. `USW-Enterprise-24-PoE`, now the name of firmware code `US624P`). The lookup index now falls back to a case-insensitive `name` match, honouring the documented "accepts both store SKUs and firmware platform codes" contract
- `render_device_port_overview` Connected column was always empty: MAC-keyed port/client maps (from `build_port_map`/`build_client_port_map`) were filtered by device display name, which never matched since the node-id migration. The maps are now translated to display names, so connected devices show correctly. Pass the new optional `node_names` (MAC-to-display-name map, as `render_svg`/`render_mermaid` accept) to also resolve connected client names (closes #67)

## [3.0.1] - 2026-07-19

Full-codebase review remediation. See `docs/code-review-2026-07.md` for the
underlying findings. This is a major release: it contains three breaking
contract changes (marked **BREAKING** below).

### Security
- Sanitize `node_type` before interpolating it into SVG paint references. A crafted node type (e.g. via `node_types`) could previously inject arbitrary SVG attributes and execute script when the diagram was embedded inline. Unknown types now fall back to the `other` gradient instead of rendering an invisible node body
- Validate `node_data` attribute *names* against `^[A-Za-z_][\w-]*$` (values were already escaped); invalid keys are dropped instead of injecting attributes
- Strip XML-invalid control characters from group names in SVG output (previously used `html.escape`, which left them intact and produced an unparseable document)
- Keep `password` and `api_key` out of `Config`'s repr/str/tracebacks (`field(repr=False)`), so they no longer leak into logs or pytest output
- Restrict the theme `font_family` slug to `[a-z0-9-]` to prevent path traversal into the embedded-font loader
- Write cache files owner-only (`0600`); they contain MACs, IPs, and hostnames and were previously created world-readable

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** `fetch_*` now raise the `UnifiError` hierarchy (e.g. `UnifiApiError`) for network failures instead of leaking raw `requests` exceptions. `UnifiError` gains a `status_code` attribute. Consumers catching `requests.ConnectionError`/`requests.RequestException` must catch `UnifiError` instead
- **BREAKING:** Edge change events from `compare_topologies` now use `entity_type="edge"` (previously `"device"`). Code filtering diff events via `TopologyDiff.filter(entity_types={"device"})` will no longer match edges; use `{"edge"}`
- `Topology.from_dict` now raises `ValueError` on a snapshot whose `version` is newer than supported, instead of silently mis-deserializing it (existing snapshots are `version` 1 and unaffected)
- **BREAKING:** `collapse_client_edges` is now pure: it no longer mutates the `node_types`/`node_names` arguments and returns a `CollapsedClientEdges` named tuple `(edges, client_counts, node_types, node_names)` instead of `(edges, client_counts)`
- HTTP requests now default to a 30s timeout (`UNIFI_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` still overrides); previously an unset timeout meant a hung controller blocked fetches indefinitely
- Retries are now limited to transient errors — authentication failures and 4xx responses surface immediately instead of being retried up to 20 times (which risked controller rate-limiting/lockout)
- `normalize_devices` now skips and logs a malformed device rather than raising for the whole site; a single bad LLDP `local_port_idx` or a device missing name/MAC no longer aborts normalization
- `normalize_mac` canonicalizes separators (e.g. `AA-BB-..` and `aabbcc..` become `aa:bb:..`), so dash/no-separator MACs now match the device index consistently. This can change node IDs for third-party LLDP peers
- Client diffs no longer emit `node_changed` events for `signal`/`satisfaction` fluctuations (they change every poll); channel and the stable properties are still compared
- Mermaid label escaping now uses Mermaid-native forms (`#quot;` for quotes, `<br/>` for newlines) instead of unsupported backslash escapes; a single quote in a device name no longer breaks the whole diagram
- Reverse DNS resolution now runs concurrently over a bounded thread pool, and an invalid (non-IP) `dns_server` is logged at warning level instead of being silently swallowed

### Fixed
- **LLDP/Markdown port tables lost all connected-device and client data** after the v2 MAC-id migration: the maps became MAC-keyed but were looked up by device name. Port tables again show connected devices and client names
- WAN1 could resolve to the WAN2 port because assignment matching was substring-based (`"wan" in "wan2"`); matching is now exact, so both interfaces map to distinct ports
- `Device.in_gateway_mode` is now serialized and restored; a UX device in AP mode was previously reclassified as a gateway after a snapshot round-trip
- Third-party LLDP peers seen with different MAC casing/format no longer render as duplicate nodes
- `is_wired` is coerced with `as_bool`, so a stringly-typed `"false"` no longer misclassifies a wireless client as wired
- `native_vlan: true` (and similar boolean payloads) no longer coerce to VLAN 1 in integer fields
- `invalidate_cache` can now actually invalidate `devices` entries (it omitted the detail cache-key extra and silently removed nothing)
- Cache-directory resolution failures (e.g. a symlinked `.cache`) degrade to no-cache instead of raising `ValueError` from every fetch, including with `use_cache=False`
- `swap_firewall_policy_order` rolls back the first PUT if the second fails, instead of leaving both policies with a duplicate index
- API responses whose `data` field is not a list are rejected at the boundary with `UnifiApiError` instead of failing deep in model code
- Client `fw_version` is preserved through a snapshot round-trip (firmware no longer goes missing from restored inventories)
- Snapshot loaders tolerate JSON `null` for list fields (`vlans`, `active_vlans`, `tagged_vlans`) instead of raising `TypeError`
- Falsy VLAN 0 / port 0 are no longer coalesced away to a later key when comparing clients
- Devices with an empty MAC no longer collide on the diff key and get compared against each other
- Mermaid `linkStyle` indices are offset past the WAN link, so PoE/wireless styling targets the correct edges when a WAN node is present
- Mermaid rendering no longer raises `KeyError` when the gateway is typed but appears in no edge or group
- The device details table is no longer duplicated in each LLDP ports section
- `render_device_inventory_table` and multi-client entries now escape Markdown special characters (a `|` no longer misaligns the table)
- Orthogonal VPN overlay box is placed in reserved space at the canvas bottom instead of overlapping the level-1 nodes below the gateway
- Isometric floor grid is aligned with the node tiles (both now share the same offset)
- Group labels preserve mixed case (e.g. "IoT" renders as "IoT", not "Iot")
- A narrow negative UniFi flag (e.g. `is_uap: False` on a wired Protect camera) no longer overrides positive ucore device info when classifying a client as UniFi
- Authenticated sessions are retained across firewall writes instead of being discarded (which forced a fresh login on the next fetch)
- Constructing a `verify_ssl=False` client no longer disables `InsecureRequestWarning` process-wide; suppression is scoped per request
- Importing `unifi_topology.model.mock` without the optional `faker` package now raises a clear `ImportError` explaining the install
- Legacy controllers are no longer probed with a doomed UDM Pro login on every fetch (the auth style is remembered per URL), reducing 429 rate-limiting risk
- CI: the PyPI publish workflow now runs the test suite before building; the exact-pinned build backend was relaxed to avoid sdist install breakage; `click`, `msgpack`, and `pip` bumped to patched versions

### Internal
- Split `diff.py` (548 lines) into `_diff_events`, `_diff_engine`, and `_diff_specs` with `compare_topologies` as a thin facade
- Removed two callable-injection layers (`_fetch.fetch_cached`, `_svg_render_flow`) and de-duplicated overlay box-metrics, VLAN striped-edge rendering, WAN-speed formatting, and the gateway-position helper across the SVG renderers
- Model classification/coercion/edge facades no longer re-export private helpers; tests import from the real private modules
- Introduced a `ClientRecord` type alias and removed the `# type: ignore` cluster in `topology.py`
- Corrected stale facts in `AGENTS.md` (version, complexity limit, Jinja2 dependency, module layout)

## [2.2.2] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed
- Strip XML-invalid control characters (e.g. U+0003) from device/client names before SVG serialization. A single illegal character from a misencoded name previously produced an unparseable SVG, breaking the entire render for downstream consumers. Both text-content and attribute (`data-node-id`, `data-edge-left/right`, `data-group`) contexts are now sanitized (closes #51)

## [2.2.1] - 2026-05-25
### Added
- Chores: updated dependencies

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- UniFi OS API-key authentication: set `Config(api_key=...)` (or `UNIFI_API_KEY` env var) to authenticate via the `X-API-KEY` header instead of username/password. Avoids cookie-based login retries that can trip `AUTHENTICATION_FAILED_LIMIT_REACHED` on the controller. `user`/`password` remain supported; configs must supply exactly one of the two auth modes (closes #47)

## [2.1.2] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- Filter bogus `public_ip` values: reject loopback, private, link-local, and unspecified addresses from `connect_request_ip` so the renderer falls back to `ip_address` (closes #37)

## [2.1.1] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- Downgraded "missing LLDP info; using uplink fallback" log from WARNING to DEBUG to reduce noise for offline/seasonal devices (closes #34)

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- `Device.public_ip` and `WanInterface.public_ip` fields exposing the `connect_request_ip` from the UniFi API, showing the actual public IP under CGNAT instead of the carrier-assigned address (closes #33)
- Playwright-based specs scraper for products where the store JSON API no longer provides technical specifications (closes #32)
- `specs_overrides.json` with dimensions, weight, power, and form factor for 29 product pages covering 42 model entries (UCG-Fiber, UCG-Max, USW-Ultra series, ECS switches, phones, LTE, PDUs, and more)
- `make update-models` target that runs both the JSON API scraper and the Playwright scraper

### Fixed
- `lookup_model_specs()` now returns specs for 237/326 models (up from 195), including all current-gen Cloud Gateways and Switch Ultra devices (closes #32)
- Cyclic import between `topology` and `clients` modules (CodeQL #194)
- CodeQL alerts #197, #198, #199 (unused global variable, empty except clauses)

## [2.0.0] (2026-03-23)

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Node identification switched from device names to normalized MAC addresses throughout the pipeline (fixes #31)
  - `Edge.left` / `Edge.right` now contain normalized MAC addresses instead of device names
  - `build_node_type_map()` returns a MAC-keyed dict instead of name-keyed
  - `build_topology()` `gateways` parameter now expects MAC addresses
  - `group_devices_by_type()` returns MAC lists instead of name lists
  - `collapse_client_edges()` cluster IDs changed from `"{name} ({n} clients)"` to `"{mac}__cluster"`; accepts optional `node_names` parameter
  - `build_client_edges()` accepts optional `node_names` parameter for label generation
  - `build_client_port_map()` returns MAC-keyed dict
  - SVG `data-node-id` attributes now contain MAC addresses
  - `render_svg()`, `render_svg_isometric()`, `render_mermaid()`, `render_dual()` accept optional `node_names` parameter for display labels
- Internal edge discovery uses MAC-based lookups: `_uplink_name` renamed to `_uplink_id`, `_lldp_peer_name` renamed to `_lldp_peer_id`, `EdgeInputs.device_by_name` renamed to `EdgeInputs.device_by_id`

### Added
- `build_node_names(devices, clients)` function to build a combined MAC-to-display-name mapping for all nodes
- `TopologyResult.node_names` field providing device MAC-to-name lookup from topology building

### Fixed
- Devices with duplicate display names no longer collapse into a single node (fixes #31)

## [1.3.2] (2026-03-20)

### Added
- `list_all_models()` public function to return the complete model lookup table with all model codes and their specs, docs, and URLs

## [1.3.1] (2026-03-19)

### Added

- `lookup_model_docs()` and `lookup_firmware_changelog()` for documentation and release notes links
- Scraper extended to cross-reference the official Ubiquiti firmware API with the store, including datasheet and firmware changelog URLs

## [1.2.3] (2026-03-16)

### Fixed
- Incomplete URL substring sanitization in test suite (CodeQL #193)
- `models.json` not included in PyPI wheel, causing model name lookup to silently return empty (fixes #22)

## [1.2.2] (2026-03-15)

### Added
- Model name lookup table scraped from the official Ubiquiti store (`lookup_model_name`, `lookup_model_url`)
- `normalize_device_stats` now resolves `model_name` from the lookup table when the API omits it (fixes #21)
